# behind the scenes of interactive charts

Repo for my presentation at the [Austrian and Slovenian Statistical Days 2022](http://www.stat.tugraz.at/StatisticalDays2022/index.html) at TU Graz. 
The abstract can be found in [`abstract.md`](abstract.md) and additional metadata is available in [`meta.json`](meta.json).
Slides will be added here if the talk is accepted by the committee.

The talk will be about the same project as my [uRos2021 presentation](https://github.com/GregorDeCillia/pipedream/).
However since this is not an R conference it will be less technical.
Instead, the focus will lie on the authors of our website articles. 
How can they be empowered to generate interactive charts and tables without assistance from developers or designers?

The presentation will include sneak-peeks for the new webpage of Statistics Austria and the [STATcube API](https://github.com/statistikat/STATcubeR/).
